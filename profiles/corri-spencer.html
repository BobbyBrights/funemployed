    <h3 id="could-you-just-introduce-yourself-and-gimme-an-update-on-who-you-are-what-are-you-doing-and-where-youre-based">Could you just introduce yourself, and gimme an update on who you are, what are you doing and where youâ€™re based?</h3>

<p>Hi ya! names Corri Spencer, I am a freelance designer/illustrator out of Cleveland. Currently working out the kinks for this neat collab I have going with the good folks over at Urban Outfitters.</p>

<h3 id="howd-you-land-that-how-long-have-you-been-freelancing-for">Howâ€™d you land that? How long have you been freelancing for?</h3>

<p>Well, my girlfriend Nashelle actually encouraged me to look into it after she shopped around a bit and saw a few neat collabs. So I reached out and luckily they answered! Ha Ha</p>

<h3 id="oh-awesome-so-how-long-have-you-been-freelancing-for-now-and-what-other-kinds-of-projects-have-you-been-working-on">Oh awesome! So how long have you been freelancing for now, and what other kinds of projects have you been working on?</h3>

<p>Well iâ€™ve been freelancing for little over a year now. and aside from UO iâ€™m not really designing at presentâ€”iâ€™m getting really back into gaming. i love fighting games, recently picked up some emulator software to run Marvel v. Capcom, King of Fighters and Street fighter ha ha</p>

<h3 id="so-before-this-you-were-working-at-snap-what-did-you-get-up-to-there">So before this you were working at Snap? What did you get up to there?</h3>

<p>Oh yeah so before UO i was designing geofilters specifically for los angeles, which was an awesome experience but as you can imagine that could get pretty stale pretty quick ha ha</p>

<h3 id="was-this-a-freelance-gig-or-full-time">Was this a freelance gig or full time?</h3>

<p>Wellâ€¦ both actually! I was brought in under freelance terms initially but i was brought back for more full time stuff.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-draws-personally-draws-you-to-freelancing-and-is-it-something-youve-personally-sought-out-or-was-it-something-you-kinda-just-fell-into">So what draws personally draws you to freelancing? and is it something youâ€™ve personally sought out, or was it something you kinda just fell into?</h3>

<p>Freelancing is one of those things that kind of just happened from necessity. Initially i only drew/doodled/painted as a hobby but once i lost my glamorous job as a sandwich maker i decided to paint full time. I got picked up by ASAPMOB to create some merchandise and ad stuff. Working with some of the other guys within the group kind of opened my eyes up to what design was and what it could be. Personally i didnâ€™t care for their work but it drew me into the medium.</p>

<h3 id="oh-sick-sounds-like-a-great-opportunity-so-i-take-it-you-didnt-study-design-all-self-taught">Oh sick! Sounds like a great opportunity So I take it you didnâ€™t study design, all self taught?</h3>

<p>yessir iâ€™m a homegrown you-tube baby!</p>

<h3 id="sweeet-so-can-you-tell-me-more-about-the-stuff-with-asapmob-howd-you-hook-that-up-what-kind-of-stuff-were-you-working-on-and-what-was-it-like-working-with-them">Sweeet! So can you tell me more about the stuff with ASAPMOB? Howâ€™d you hook that up, what kind of stuff were you working on and what was it like working with them?</h3>
