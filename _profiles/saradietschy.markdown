**Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?**

Hello, my name is Mohammad Dimas. I'm the front-end developer and one of the initial team members of Mailbird. I have a background in computer science. After graduating from university I worked in a digital agency to gain experiences in working with many international clients. Not long after that, I met the other co-founders to build Mailbird.
