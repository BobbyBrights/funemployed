Alright – I guess this is pretty vain, but I thought I’d start this website off by featuring myself. If anything I guess it’ll serve as an introduction into who I am and my motivations behind this little project you’re currently on. It’s also an easy way to test out some questions I’ll use for profiles in the future.


### Who are you, what are you currently doing to make a living, where are you based?

I am Matthew Vernon, a freelance digital designer from Sydney, Australia. I spent the bulk of my days working out of my bedroom for a range of startups – usually on web design projects. I also love to work on side projects and my own ideas in my free time – this site is one of them. Another main side project of mine is [Neue Goods](http://neuegoods.com) – a clothing label I have been running for almost two years.


### How long have you been freelancing?

I have been working on freelance projects for almost as long as I have been a designer. One of my first real projects was working on the design of a printed flyer for a local cleaning company back when I was in my first year of design school. I charged $50. I continued to take on projects all through design school – and my first full time positions, but I officially left to freelance on a full time basis in February of 2016.


### Did you ever work as a designer in a full time role?

Yes, I had two full time positions – one at a tech startup and one at a digital agency. I always had ambitions to work for myself, freelance or start a company of sorts, but after graduation I still felt like there was a lot more for me to learn, and room for me to grow as a designer. Although I would’ve loved to freelance straight out of school like some lucky people, I just didn’t think I had the skills or know how to make it work. I figured getting some experience in some full time roles would be a great way for me to learn the ins and outs of the industry, and possibly receive some mentorship before jumping in to freelance.

Funnily enough – this wasn’t the case, as I was thrown right into the deep end in both positions, with very little help or mentorship. I had to learn things out for myself through experience. This was actually great, because I felt like I progressed as a designer much quicker than other people. I went from fresh out of design school, into a somewhat ‘mid-weight’ role almost immediately.


### What motivated you to make the jump into freelancing?

From a very young age I have always wanted to have a sense of independence. I have always admired people who have been able to make a living from something they love and enjoy, and aimed to some day reach that point. It’s a bit left of field – but when I was a teenager I was very interested in punk, hardcore, skateboarding and all the other shit that comes along with being a ratchet kid from the suburbs. I looked up to people that went against the grain of society and I believe these subcultures have very much instilled a sense of ideals that is still present in me today. I may not be a pro skateboarder, or touring the world in a hardcore band – but I believe working for myself is a pretty good compromise.


### Was it a conscious decision – or was it something you fell into?

Yes and no. Yes – in that I had always planned to go freelance, but also no because the opportunity to actually quit full time work kind of just fell into my lap. I was working at an agency, and had been in talks with potentially working with the dudes at Made Together, another studio here in Sydney. I told them I was really keen to freelance one day, and they said they’d be open to facilitating that process for me by letting me work for them a few days a week. I had a holiday to Japan lined up, so I figured – fuck it. I’ll quit my job, head off to Japan, come back unemployed, work with these dudes for a few days a week and try to win some of my own clients on the side. If it didn’t work, I could always just find another job.

Of course – things didn’t go as planned, Made Together were still in the process of securing some new clients when I returned, so they weren’t ready for me to start working yet. I didn’t have much money saved, so I had to find clients fast. This ended up working well, as it threw me in the deep end and I was forced to make it work.


### Prior to leaving full time work, what steps did you put in place to prepare yourself for freelancing?

I don’t think I put much preparation making the leap at all. I didn’t have a lot of money saved up, I didn’t have clients or projects lined up and I didn’t know a lot about running a legit freelance business.

But now that I look back on it, it was definitely something that was years in the making. All the work I had been putting in prior to leaving – like my side projects, my website/portfolio, and my previous freelance experience really provided a nice foundation for me to launch into full-time freelance from.


### How did you secure your first freelance client?

A lot of my first projects weren’t actually independent projects with my own clients – they were temporary in-house roles at design studios and startups. For the first 6 or so months of freelancing, I would be jumping between studios and startups (and the agency I worked at full time) doing 2 days here, 3 days there.. charging each studio a day rate.

The agency I worked at full time needed some help after I had quit, so I came back in as a freelance for a few days/week for a few weeks. The other roles I had found online ads for, or were found via word of mouth.

It actually took a while for me to secure my first few real, independent clients. There were a few projects I got from random emails from people who had heard about me from friends, but another way I secured a lot of work was from Facebook Groups. I’m a member of a Facebook group that contains people from the Sydney startup community. It’s full of developers, engineers, growth hackers and people running their own startups – which means, there’s a lot of people that need to hire designers. Every couple of months I put up a post with portfolio and I’ll usually receive a few clients from it.


### How do you charge clients?

For agencies, startups and ongoing projects – I’ll charge a day rate. At the moment my day rate is somewhere between $400–$700/day. To calculate this, I doubled what I was earning full-time (to account for expenses, tax and super) and then whacked some more on top to account for periods where I am without work. I’ll charge clients less if they can guarantee work for an extended period of time, and I’ll also add on a “dickhead fee” for shit clients who I do not enjoy working with.

For independent projects with a scope – I’ll provide a flat rate quote. I usually work this out by estimating how many days I’ll need to spend on it, and then multiplying that by my day rate to calculate how much I should charge.
